# SumoBot
It takes two to tango!

As part of Grade 11 Computer Engineering, my partner and I created a fully autonomous SUMOBOT. The objective of the robot was to push another SUMOBOT out of the ring to win the sumo match. Highlights include:
- Fully autonomous
- Became familiar with ultrasonic, infrared and photoelectric sensors
- Because proficient in using an Arduino UNO board and the Arduino IDE
- Designed, etched, and soldered custom circuit boards
